If you're like me, you've heard of several programming languages that sound interesting that you might not ever use. Elm, Python, Ruby, Elixir, ReasonML - there's a lot going on in this world of ours. This little repo aims to give you a chance at solving a small, interesting problem in some of those languages. I'm just getting started here, so there's not much to see. Want to add a link for a certain language that you love? I would be happy to include it here.
